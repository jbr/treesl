h1. TreeSL

TreeSL is my effort to define a flexible domain specific language (DSL).  I think it's similar to a recursive descent parser.

TreeSL will try a number of alternative matches for a given node until it finds a matching alternative.  This is incredibly inefficient, but the goal is flexibility, not on-the-fly DSL speed.
